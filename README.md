# TICTACTO
Tic-Tac-Toe is played on a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns marking X and O in the empty cells of the grid. The first player to achieve a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with their mark wins the game. If all cells are filled without any player achieving a winning line, the game is a draw.
